### Description
P07_00_00 Raindrop Bob  
Raindrop Bob is a domotics project for watering and monitoring plant moisture for house plants. The project incorporates aspects of soil moisture sensing, automatic irrigation, water level sensing and data logging. This project is designed to address issues of maintaining plant health while Iâ€™m away. 
 * Soil moisture sensing with homebrew sensors
 * watering managed with 3x DC peristaltic pumps
 * Reservoir monitoring (tbd)
 * Data logging (tbd)

### Progress log 
 * 2020-05-23 Got most of the hardware for the project 
 * 2020-05-23 Testing blink sketch successful
 * 2020-05-23 Test relay output (Successful) 
 * 2020-05-23 Test diy soil moisture sensor (Successful)
 * 2020-05-23 Search for a way to detect reservoir volume
 * 2020-05-29 Made soil moisture sensors
 * 2020-05-29 Building capacitive water tank
 * 2020-06-03 Discovered that I didn't do a great job on soldering the SD Card so that's why it wasn't working
 * 2020-06-04 Need to supply 5V not 3.3V power supply to SD card
 * 2020-06-05 Wired up the full setup without motors and sensors
 * 2020-06-05 Discovered that getting 3.3V with 1kohm resistors and 2.2kohm resistors doesn't work 100ohm and 220ohm resistors works well remember CS pin 10
 * 2020-06-06 Testing motor control: 40*500ms = 1Tb of water
 * 2020-06-06 Testing soil moisture sensors all seem to work needs calibration
 * 2020-06-07 Building capacitive reservoir level sensor
 * 2020-06-07 Shielding reservoir sensor wires it's a pia
 * 2020-06-07 Capacitive reservoir sensor is working calibration needed 
 * 2020-06-08 Add project to GitHub
 * 2020-06-09 Added TestSD project 
 * 2020-06-09 Added TestSensor project
